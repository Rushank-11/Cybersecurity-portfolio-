## 🔐 SCADA Brute Force Authentication Testing

This project demonstrates a brute force attack targeting a SCADA system (ScadaBR) login page, performed within a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux. The objective was to simulate a password attack using real-world leaked credentials and observe authentication behaviors.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project was conducted strictly for educational and ethical hacking purposes in a controlled environment. Never attempt unauthorized access on any live or production system.

---

### 🧪 Environment Setup

- **Operating System**: Kali Linux (VM)
- **Target Application**: [ScadaBR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scadabr/)
- **Target URL**: `http://192.168.95.5:8080/ScadaBR`
- **Tool Used**: `Wfuzz` for brute force fuzzing

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### **Step 1: Wordlist Preparation**

A well-known leaked password list was used to simulate the attack:

- **File Used**: `rockyou.txt`
- **Path**: `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
- **Password Count**: ~14 million compromised entries

#### **Step 2: Creating or Selecting a Username List**

A custom `users.txt` file was created to supply potential usernames during the attack.

- **Path**: `/usr/share/wordlists/users.txt`
- **Usernames**:
  ```
  user
  scadabr
  admin
  root
  test
  ```

> 💡 **Tip**: If you're unsure which usernames to try, Kali Linux provides several pre-compiled username lists in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` directory. One such list is:
> 
> ```
> /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_users.txt
> ```
> 
> These built-in lists contain commonly used or default usernames and can be helpful in broad enumeration efforts.

#### **Step 3: Executing the Brute Force Attack**

The attack was launched using `Wfuzz`, targeting the ScadaBR login endpoint.

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/users.txt \
      -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
      -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z" \
      --hc 200 \
      http://192.168.95.5:8080/ScadaBR/j_security_check
```

- `FUZZ` and `FUZ2Z` are placeholders for dynamic fuzzing inputs.
- `--hc 200` hides HTTP 200 responses (commonly used for failed login attempts).

---

### 📊 Observations

- **Typical Response**: Most requests returned HTTP 200, indicating failed logins.
- **Notable Response**: One request returned HTTP **302** (redirect), suggesting successful login.

  - **Credentials**:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `cowboys`

---

### ✅ Successful Login

Upon manually entering the discovered credentials on the ScadaBR web interface, login was successful.

**Result**: ✅ *Authentication Bypassed – Access Gained*

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Systems without rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or account lockout policies are highly vulnerable to brute force attacks.
- Monitoring HTTP status codes during fuzzing can reveal signs of successful authentication.
- Built-in username and password lists in Kali Linux significantly accelerate enumeration efforts.
- Always conduct testing in isolated environments and ensure ethical guidelines are followed.
