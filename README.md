🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – Sai Rushank Ketha

Welcome to my cybersecurity project portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects where I explore ethical hacking, penetration testing, digital forensics, and secure infrastructure practices using tools like Kali Linux, Wfuzz, Metasploit, and more.

📂 Projects

🔐 [Brute Force Password Cracker](./Brute%20force%20password%20cracker/)
Performed a brute-force login attack on a SCADA system (ScadaBR) using Wfuzz and custom username/password wordlists. Identified valid credentials by analyzing HTTP response codes.
- Tools used: Kali Linux, Wfuzz
- Highlights:
  - Used `rockyou.txt` with 14M passwords
  - Response code 302 revealed correct credentials
- 📸 Screenshot:

🧪 [Digital Forensics Analysis](./Digital%20Forensics%20Analysis/)
Investigated and analyzed disk images to extract evidence using Autopsy and FTK Imager. Documented findings and chain of custody for digital artifacts.


🔑 [KeyVaultConnect – Securing Remote Access with SSH Keys](./KeyVaultConnect%20–%20Securing%20Remote%20Access%20with%20SSH%20Keys/)
Secured remote server access using SSH key pairs instead of passwords. Demonstrated key generation, public key distribution, and best practices for identity-based authentication.

 
🔍 [File Permission Demo in Linux](./file%20permisssion%20in%20linux%20distributions.md)
Explored Linux file permission concepts (chmod, chown, umask). Demonstrated privilege escalation risks and mitigation through proper file access control.
